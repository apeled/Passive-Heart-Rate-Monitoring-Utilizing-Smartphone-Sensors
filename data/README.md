# The `\data` Directory

This directory contains several video samples utilized in our project.

## Naming Convention

The video files follow the below naming convention:

1. `Date`: The date when the video sample was captured, presented in the `YYYYMMDD` format.
2. `Initial`: The initials of the individual who captured the video.
3. `Number`: A sequential number for the video.
4. `Location`: The location on the subject where the video was captured.
5. `FPS`: The frames-per-second (FPS) rate at which the video was recorded.
6. `EV`: The exposure value (EV) setting on the camera during the recording of the video.

Here's an example of a file name: `20230801_AH_01_IF_30_1.5.mp4`. This video was captured on August 1, 2023, by a person with initials 'AH', at location 'IF', Index Finger, with a frame rate of 30 FPS and an exposure value of 1.5.

## Usage

To utilize these videos in your code, use the relative path to each video from your working directory.
